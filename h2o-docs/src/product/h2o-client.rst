H2O Clients
===========

These clients allow you to connect to and interact with H2O.

H2O Flow
--------

H2O Flow is an open-source user interface for H2O, and it is a web-based interactive environment that allows you to combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots, and rich media in a single document. Documentation for H2O Flow can be found `here <flow.html>`__.

R Client
--------

R uses REST API to connect to H2O and allows you to run basic H2O commands using R commands. Documentation for the R Client can be found `here <../h2o-r/docs/index.html>`__.

Python Client
-------------

Python users can connect to H2O and can also use H2O with IPython notebooks. Documentation for the Python Client can be found `here <../h2o-py/docs/index.html>`__. 

Sklearn Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most H2O estimators available in the Python client can be used in the standard ``sklearn`` API. The ``h2o.sklearn`` module provides a collection of wrappers auto-generated on top of the original estimators and transformers, as well as on top of ``H2OAutoML``.
