====================================
Upload to PyPi
====================================

Step 1:
python setup.py bdist_wheel

Step 2:
Register here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=submit_form

Step 3: Use twine to upload the wheel
twine upload dist/*whl


To Download:

(may have to upgrade pip)

pip install --upgrade pip


If you've downloaded before:

pip install --pre h2o --upgrade


If it's your first time:

pip install --pre h2o


====================================
Upload to Anaconda
====================================

1. If this is your first time, then run

        $ conda config --set anaconda_upload yes

2. (This step can be skipped if you just built package for PyPi)

        $ python setup.py bdist_wheel

3. Modify package version number within this file (we need to automate this step somehow):

        $ sublime conda/h2o/meta.yaml

4. Build the conda package and upload to anaconda automatically
        $ cd conda
        $ conda build h2o
