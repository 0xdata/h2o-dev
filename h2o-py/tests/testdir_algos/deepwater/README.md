# Deep Water Python Tests

### What can Deep Water do?
* Train user-defined or pre-defined deeplearning models for image classification
* Train on a single GPU or CPU (requires CUDA)
* Uses the MXNet backend
* Behave just like any other H2O model (Flow, cross-validation, early stopping, hyper-parameter search, etc.)
